/* ------------ Functions ----------- */

/*
  Functions are reusable blocks of code that we can call to perform a specific task.
  We can pass values into functions to change their behavior. Functions have their own local scope as opposed to global scope


/*
** Function Syntax
  function functionName($arg1, $arg2, ...) {
    // code to be executed
  }
